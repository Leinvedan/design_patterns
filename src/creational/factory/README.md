# Factory

One of the main advantages about Factory is encapsulation. By not using the `new` keyword, you move control of instantiation to the factory, allowing future performance improvements.
The difference between Factory and Prototype is that the Prototype must be instantiated first. The Factory can have several subclasses but it can be a static class.
